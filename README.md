This is Sergio Andres Martinez CV, front end created with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) Project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This project is made as a little showcase of my coding skills and knowledge, so please feel free to check out this repo and run it if you consider necessary or funny ;)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Back End

Most of the content is fetched from an API, which fetchs data from a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) Database

- [API Repo](https://github.com/ElSamplio/samp-cv-api-nest) - Made with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/).

## Deployed on Vercel

Following NextJS documentation, I founf that the easiest way to deploy my Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
